Hello!

In order to run this program please follow these simple steps:

1.Fork/clone this repo on to your local machine.

2.Make sure you have python 2.7 installed.(Older versions will work but you have to do some modifications to code).

3.If you are runnig in linux, open up terminal and access the repository where this is located.

4.Access the project's repository and on the command line type "python *.py".  This will run all the files that end in .py and as a result, open the website.

5.Enjoy!

If you are using another OS, perhaps your IDE will allow you to compile the files and execute the program.
